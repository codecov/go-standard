## What is this?

This is a **Go** application, with basic unit tests, for which coverage is uploaded to Codecov on a daily basis. It can also serve as an example for how to integrate Codecov into your Go project. If the build is passing for this project, then Codecov's Go report processing is functional and correct on codecov.io.

## Configuration

This project is written in `Go`. Unit test are written using the go `testing` framework and coverage reports are generated using the `go` CLI.

## Usage

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### The Local Way

Run tests
```
go test -race -coverprofile=coverage.txt -covermode=atomic
```
